# MSc Thesis TUD - boomerang correspondence
 



note: Code is not cleaned up, but does work; main looop is in Thesis-Correspondence.exe (better to run in release mode)
Build using CMAKE, you might have to manually install a library or two. Some things are hardcoded in code, e.g. if you want to swap your model, you have to change it Thesis-Correspondence.cpp
